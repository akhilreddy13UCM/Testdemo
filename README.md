Junit and mockito demo
JUnit is one of the most widely used testing frameworks in the Java ecosystem. JUnit provides a simple and standardized way to write test cases, execute them, and report the results.

Asserts, on the other hand, is not a testing framework but rather a library that complements testing frameworks like JUnit. It focuses on providing fluent and expressive assertions, enhancing the readability and maintainability of your test code 

JUnit and Assert are both popular tools used in Java for testing, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features.
